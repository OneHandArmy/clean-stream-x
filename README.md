# clean-stream-x

A lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension designed to help you regain control over your digital habits.
🛡️ Privacy & Habit Control

In a world of "attention economies," this tool is designed to put you back in the driver's seat. Whether it's reducing mindless scrolling or managing digital distractions, the goal is to help you build better habits without sacrificing your personal data.

    Zero Tracking: We don't collect, store, or sell your browsing data.

    Local Processing: All habit-control logic happens directly on your device.

    Mindful Design: Built to assist your focus, not to add more digital noise.

👐 Open Source & Community-Driven

This plugin is fully open-source. I believe that tools built for privacy and personal well-being should be transparent and accessible to everyone.

    A Note from the Author: > I am happy for anyone to improve this project in the name of privacy and habit control! If you see a way to make the code more efficient, the privacy protections stronger, or the habit features more effective, your contributions are incredibly welcome.
